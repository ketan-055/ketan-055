# Hi there 👋 I'm Ketan Marathe

I'm a Computer Engineering student with a strong foundation in full-stack web development, backend systems, and scalable application design. I enjoy building complete web solutions—whether it's a student event management portal using Laravel and MySQL, a modern task tracker with React and Node.js, or an API-driven backend service integrated with cloud platforms.

🌐 I'm passionate about:
- Clean, maintainable full-stack code
- User-centered design and performance optimization
- React, Tailwind CSS, Laravel, Node.js, and Firebase
- Cloud deployment & backend integration

🛠️ Tech I work with:
HTML · CSS · JavaScript · PHP · MySQL  
React · Express.js · Laravel · Firebase  
Git · GitHub · VS Code · Figma

📘 When I’m not coding:
- Exploring design patterns & modern JS frameworks
- Contributing to open-source
- Learning system design and scalable architecture
